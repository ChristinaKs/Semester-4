Successful systems must:
* Satisfy business requirements, their features and functionality and meet usersâ€™ needs
* Stay within budget, using the available resources
* Be completed on time

There are often tradeoffs -- You have to pick two out of three :
* Good and fast, but costly
* Fast and cheap, but lesser quality
* Cheap and Good, but takes more time

## Why Projects Fail
* Incomplete/Change in requirements
* Unclear requirements, targets or scope
* Limited user involvement
* Lack of executive support
* Lack of technical support
* Poor planning 
* Poor design choices
* Unclear objectives
* Unrealistic cost estimates
* Lack of required resources
* Poor monitoring and control of progress
* Inadequate reaction to early signs of problems
* Failure to recognize activity dependencies
* Personality conflicts and employee turnover
* Shortcuts or sloppy work
* Insufficient testing or test procedures
* Lack of software change control
* Changes in culture, funding, or objectives

## Participants in Development Projects
* Client/sponsor
    * The person or group who funds the project
* User or users 
    * The person or group who will actually use the new system
* Oversight committee (larger organizations)
    * Representatives of clients and management
    * Review and direct the project
    * Board of trustees for a company

## Elements of Project Management
| Element | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| Scope Management | - Defining and controlling the functions that are to be included in the system <br>- Scope of the work to be done by the project team |
| Time Management | - Building a detailed schedule of all project tasks <br>- Monitoring the progress of the project against defined milestones |
| Cost Management | - Calculating initial cost/benefit abalysis and later updates<br>- Monitoring expenditures as the project progresses |
| Quality Management | - Establishing a total plan for ensuring quality<br>- Includes quality control activities for every phase of the project |
| Human Resource Management | - Recruiting and hiring project team members<br>- Training, motivating, team building to ensure a happy, productive team |
| Communications Management | - Identifying what and how to communicate to all stakeholders<br>- Establish communications mechanisms and schedules |

## Project Manager
* Coordinates project development
* Creates a detailed plan at project inception<br>&emsp; Activities that must take place<br>&emsp; Deliverables that must be produced<br>&emsp; Resources needed
* Accountable for success or failure
* Most large projects have one
* Project manager may or may not act as a "boss"<br>&emsp; Shares authority with "architect"/"Technical lead"<br>&emsp; Sometimes the project manager is really just in charge of the schedule

## Where do projects come from? 
* Business opportunity<br>&emsp; I.e.: Restaurants needed to begin offering delivery when Covid19 shut down their dining rooms
* Long-term strategic plan (top-down)
* Department managers or process managers (bottom-up)<br>&emsp; Individual workers will see ways in which the processes in the business can be improved

## Defining problems within projects
Begore undertaking any project, having a good understanding of what problem this new system will solve is important. To determine the scope of the project, the business problem needs to be precisely defined.
* Not enough customers
* Too many customers -- System won't be able to handle the influx
* Employees -- They might not be pulling their weight
* Business processes -- insufficience
* Developped list of expected business benefits -- reason the clients are funding the new system

## System and Project scope
Project Scope<br>&emsp; **How** the project is to be built<br>&emsp; Provides data conversion information<br>&emsp; Sets parameters for quality control<br> System Scope<br>&emsp; Defines capabilities of new system
